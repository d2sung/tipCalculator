Tipper is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Daniel Sung

Time spent: 17 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Light and Dark themes in settings, including the settings page
* [X] Customizable "Mood" choices instead of having set percentage values
* [X] Bill splitting functionality with option to add more people to split bills with
* [X] "No Tip" segmented control for easy bill splitting
* [X] Original logo and app icon

## Notes

- To run, open tipCalculator.xcworkspace (NOT tipCalculator.xcodeproj) and run on iphone 5s

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Had a difficult time understanding when to programically write code or to use the storyboard/attributes menu to implement and edit views
- Understanding the lifecycle of apps
- Understanding and getting familiar with the xCode IDE in tasks such as where to save images, fonts.
- Working with animations. I relied mostly on the Canvas framework however took a while to get used to implementing animations 
- Navbar, Navigation Controller and how to edit and implement the functions it can provide

This was my first time making an app and I would love to learn more about xCode, Swift and the intricacies involved in developing a full fledged iOS app and other features I can create. I also want to learn more about layout across different devices.
